She knows her characters intimately with the result that one completely trusts her judgment every inch of the way.'

'A vibrant, admirably researched debut. A non-fictional <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>, it is piquantly evocative of that lost aesthetic echelon of 1920s and 1930s society which dissolved amid the shadows of war; and the convention-defying friendship threaded through it is enthralling.' Caroline Sanderson, writer, reviewer and Associate Editor of the <i>Bookseller</i>

'Moving, thoughtful, entertaining and magnificently researched account of a bohemian art student and a sharp-witted - sometimes comically snobbish - spinster, this is an outstandingly accomplished and original first biography from a writer for whom we can predict a very bright future.' Miranda Seymour, author of <i>In My Father's House</i> and <i>Noble Endeavours</i>
