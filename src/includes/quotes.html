    'I loved <i>A Curious Friendship</i>. Anna Thomasson in her first book, has brilliantly captured this strange coterie.' <strong>Sir Roy Strong</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    '<i>A Curious Friendship</i> tells the story of Rex Whistler and Edith Olivier with haunting novelistic
    intensity &mdash; a remarkable first book.' <strong><i>Observer Best Books of 2015</i></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    'Provides a window on to a fascinating world, and the story is narrated with elegant verve.'
    <strong>Lara Feigel, <i>Guardian</i></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    'Thoroughly researched, with elegant prose and a glittering cast of characters, Thomasson's
    account merges Victorian sensibilities with the raucous Jazz Age, giving the reader the best
    of both worlds.' <strong>Lyndsy Spence, <i>The Lady</i></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    'Exhaustively researched and movingly told, <i>A Curious Friendship</i> is a tale of colour and
    creativity but also of hope and redemption. <strong>Martin Williams, <i>Country Life</i></strong>
  </p>

    'Anna Thomasson is a wonderful writer, with a pitch-perfect ear and a marvellous sense of
    style. She knows her characters intimately with the result that one completely trusts her
    judgment every inch of the way.' <strong>Selina Hastings</strong>, author of <i>The Red Earl</i> and <i>The Secret Lives of Somerset Maugham</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    'A vibrant, admirably researched debut. A non-fictional Brideshead Revisited, it is piquantly
    evocative of that lost aesthetic echelon of 1920s and 1930s society which dissolved amid the
    shadows of war; and the convention-defying friendship threaded through it is enthralling.'
    <strong>Caroline Sanderson</strong>, writer, reviewer and Associate Editor of the <i>Bookseller</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    'Moving, thoughtful, entertaining and magnificently researched account of a bohemian art
    student and a sharp-witted - sometimes comically snobbish - spinster, this is an outstandingly
    accomplished and original first biography from a writer for whom we can predict a very bright
    future.' <strong>Miranda Seymour</strong>, author of <i>In My Father's House</i> and <i>Noble Endeavours</i>
